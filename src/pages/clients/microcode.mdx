# MicroCode

Microsoft MicroCode is a tile-based programming language and editor for young learners on the [BBC micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org). MicroCode runs in the browser or directly on the micro:bit V2 with an [Arcade shield](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield).

## Jacdac and MicroCode

MicroCode uses the [DeviceScript runtime](https://aka.ms/devicescript) to run programs. The sensor and screen of the micro:bit are exposed as Jacdac servers and extra [Jacdac modules are also supported](https://jacdac.github.io/microcode/docs/manual#accessories).
