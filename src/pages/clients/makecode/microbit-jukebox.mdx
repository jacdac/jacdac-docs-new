# Micro:bit Jukebox

The micro:bit jukebox is a program that reacts to Jacdac modules that are connected to
the micro:bit V2 over the Jacdac bus.

## Download

The micro:bit Jukebox experience is a MakeCode program that you can download or even modify!

## What to expect?

-   Plug the micro:bit into the Jacdaptor (make sure the front of the micro:bit and raised numbers on the plastic edge connector of Jacdaptor are both visible)

-   Supply power to the micro:bit

-   When a Jacdac module is added to or removed from the bus, the micro:bit displays the new count of devices on the bus

-   When a Jacdac button module is attached, the micro:bit will respond to the following events as follows

    -   Down: display a first icon on 5x5 LEDs and play a note (eight different icons and notes supported, for up to eight buttons)
    -   Hold: display a second icon
    -   Up: clear display

-   When a Jacdac sensor (slider, rotary encoder) is attached and the sensor value changes appreciably,
    micro:bit will display a bar chart showing the magnitude of the reading register, or will display the value as a number

-   When a Jacdac actuator (RGB LED strip) is attached, the micro:bit will send a command to it based
    on which button of micro:bit is pressed (A, B, A+B)

-   When a LED strip and a potentiometer (slider) are connected, the potentiometer will control the LED brightness
-   When a LED strip and a rotary encoder are connected, the rotary encoder will rotate the LEDs on the strip

## How does it work?

Whenever Jacdac detects a new device, it mounts clients for each known services with a predefined set of behaviors. It is [programmed in MakeCode](https://github.com/jacdac/pxt-jacdac/tree/master/tools/microbit-jukebox).

```javascript
machine.addClientFactory(jacdac.SRV_LIGHT_LEVEL, devid => {
    const client = new modules.LightLevelClient(devid)
    client.onLightLevelChangedBy(20, () => {
        machine.plot(client.lightLevel(), 100)
    })
})
```
