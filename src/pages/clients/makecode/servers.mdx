# MakeCode Servers

It is possible to expose the features of your micro:bit V2 via Jacdac 
by running Jacdac servers on it that use commonly defined Jacdac [services](/services). 

**This approach is used extensively to retrofit existing accessories into Jacdac services using [Software Only Jacdac](/ddk/microbit/software-only-accessory/).**

## micro:bit V2 servers

-   Open the [micro:bit editor](https://makecode.microbit.org)
-   Click on `Import` button (right side)
-   Choose `Import URL' and enter https://github.com/jacdac/pxt-jacdac/devices/microbit
-   Start any of the predefined servers based on your needs by adding code at the end of `main.ts`. In general, it's best to enable small number of servers per micro:bit. Make sure to call `jacdac.startServer()` before starting the predefined servers, as shown below.

```javascript
jacdac.startServer()
servers.buttonA.start()
servers.screenServer.start()
```
