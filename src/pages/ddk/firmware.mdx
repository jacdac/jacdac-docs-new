# Firmware

To date, we have firmware support for modules created using the following MCU families: STM32 and PADUAK.
We also provide a portable C SDK, `jacdac-c`, that can be integrated in other platforms.

## STM32F0xx and STM32G0xx

The [jacdac/jacdac-stm32x0](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-stm32x0/blob/main/README.md) repository contains both the firmware for implementing servers (eg., accelerometer server) on a Jacdac module, and a bootloader which allows for updating the firmware using the Jacdac protocol.

The best way to get started is to [clone the module template](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-module-template/generate) and follow the instruction to build your first Jacdac module firmware.

## PADUAK (8-bit)

The [jacdac/jacdac-padauk](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-padauk) repository is the starting point to build firmware for the PADUAK 8-bit series of MCUs

## Jacdac C SDK

The [jacdac/jacdac-c](https://github.com/jacdac/jacdac-c) repository implements platform-agnostic aspects of the Jacdac protocol.

## Github repository list

The Jacdac stack is layered, top-down, into [several Github repos](./github-repos).

## Flashing firmware onto hardware

We often use a simple [JacConnect programming header](./jac-connect) footprint for attaching a programmer to a Jacdac device. We have also documented how to use JacConnect with [ARM MCU tooling](./arm-tooling) and with [PADAUK MCU tooling](./padauk-tooling).
